# My Emacs Setup

Optimized mainly for Clojure, this is just my personal Emacs set up so I can always get to it after a rebuild etc.

## Fair warning

Check the current versions of all of the packages because they're probably out of date, don't run weird code you find on the internet, look both ways, don't swim for 30 minutes after eating, etc.

## To use:

Download this folder using the download zip button or git clone, move it into
your home directory and rename it to ".emacs.d"

Also depends on emacs-goodies.el, to install on Debian use "sudo apt-get install emacs-goodies-el"

Don't forget to swap your ctrl and caps-lock keys!

## Includes:

emacs-goodies (download seperately)
autopair.el (auto closes parenthesis)
rainbow-delimiters.el (gives each set of parenthesis different colors)
emacs-color-theme-solarized (best color schemes around)
nrepl.el (has been replaced by 'cider' but I haven't upgraded yet, while in Clojure mode press C-x C-z to start an inferior LISP process.)
clojure-mode.el
clojure-test-mode.el

and more random bits and pieces...
